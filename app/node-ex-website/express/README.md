### Project Idea/Status (So far)

Project is in the Design Phase

Site design will consist of an appbar that contians buttons that navigate to the various sections of the website

- Home
- Information
- Keyboards

# Home

The home tab will contain a welcome page that explains the use of this website

# Information

The information tab will be the informative center where the user can learn and read about mechanical key switches

# Keyboards

The Keyboards tab will contain the list of keyboards that contain specific switches. The user can filter the list by sound, pressure, tactile, and others to show personalized search results
The user can then click on the link that will take them to a website that has keyboards available for purchase with the specified switches.

Filtering Ideas:
    Switch Type (Color)
        General Functionality (behavior) of that switch type
    Normal Switch Usage (Gaming, FastTyping, ect.)
    Switch Sound
    Switch Image

The contents of the keyboards tab will be stored either via DB or within the site itself (i.e switch information / links)

The file structure (so far) is to have each tab of the appbar be a separate html file with a connecting javascript file that will handle all scripting
