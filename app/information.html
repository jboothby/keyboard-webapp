            <p style = "text-align: center">
              A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that features mechanical switches, which are <br>
              switches that operate using a mechanical toggle as opposed to optically registering <br>
              key presses.
            </p>
        <h2 style = "text-align: center"> Why mechanical keyboards?
        </h2>
            <p style = "text-align: center">
              A mechanical keyboard typically chosen over an optical keyboard in that they have <br>
              desirable physical aspects over optical. Namely, there is a present force needed to <br>
              move the key down in order to register a key press, as opposed to the automatic method <br>
              utilized by optical. Further, there is often an auditory clicking, which many users <br>
              find satisfying.

        <h2 style = "text-align: center"> What aspects of mechanical keyboards are important?
        </h2>
            <p style = "text-align: center">
              Generally, there are two main deciding characteristics users look for in mechanical keys: <br>
              actuation strength required and level of noise (often described as "clickiness". <br>
              Beyond this, there is actuation length (how far you have to press a key) and minor, <br>
              less quantifiable issues that boil down to minute personal preference. <br>
